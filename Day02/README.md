# Day2 Project: Tip Calculator
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª


## Day2-Task1
Instructions:
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

The last line of your program should print the result.
Example 1 Input
39
Example 1 Output
12


## Day2-Task2:
Instructions
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

Example Input 1
1.75
80
means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75

Example Output 1
26
Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837


## Day2-Task3
Instructions:
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x weeks left.
Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

Example Input
56
Example Output
You have 1768 weeks left.
